# ðŸ¤– Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm

## ðŸ”¹ How it Works
The **Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm** is an optimized version of the **Minimax Algorithm** used in two-player games.  
It eliminates branches in the game tree that **cannot possibly affect the final decision**, improving efficiency without changing the result.

- **Alpha (Î±):** The best value the maximizing player can guarantee so far.  
- **Beta (Î²):** The best value the minimizing player can guarantee so far.  
- If at any node **Î² â‰¤ Î±**, the remaining branches are **pruned** (skipped) because they will never influence the final choice.

**Process Overview:**
1. Start from the root node and apply the Minimax logic recursively.  
2. Track the best (Î±) and worst (Î²) possible values at each level.  
3. Stop exploring further when the pruning condition (Î² â‰¤ Î±) occurs.  
4. Return the same optimal value as Minimax, but with fewer computations.

## ðŸ”¹ Applications
- Used in **Game AI** (Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, Connect Four)  
- Decision-making systems involving **two opposing agents**  
- **Search optimization** where reducing time complexity is essential

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(báµˆ) in worst case, O(b^(d/2)) in best case  
  (b = branching factor, d = depth of the tree)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(b Ã— d)

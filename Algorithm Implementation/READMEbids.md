# Bidirectional Search Algorithm

## How it works
Bidirectional Search runs simultaneously from the start and goal nodes, meeting in the middle to find the path efficiently.

## Applications
- Shortest path finding in large graphs
- Route planning in maps
- Network analysis

## Complexity
- Time: O(b^(d/2)), b = branching factor, d = distance between start and goal
- Space: O(b^(d/2)) for queues and visited sets

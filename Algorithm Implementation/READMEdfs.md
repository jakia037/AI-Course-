# DFS Algorithm

## How it works
Depth-First Search (DFS) explores a graph by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Applications
- Pathfinding in graphs
- Topological sorting
- Cycle detection in graphs

## Complexity
- Time: O(V + E)
- Space: O(V) (due to recursion stack)

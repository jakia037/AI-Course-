# Best First Search Algorithm

## How it works
Best First Search explores nodes based on heuristic values, always expanding the node with the lowest heuristic estimate toward the goal.

## Applications
- Pathfinding in maps and games
- AI navigation in robotics
- Game AI decision making

## Complexity
- Time: O(E log V), E = number of edges, V = number of vertices
- Space: O(V) for visited set and priority queue

# 🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Course Project

## 🧩 i. Purpose of This Course
The main purpose of this course is to introduce the **core concepts and applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.  
Through this course, we explored how intelligent systems work — from **search algorithms** to **game-playing agents** and **AI-powered tools**.  
It helps students understand **problem-solving techniques**, **decision-making processes**, and how AI can be implemented in real-world applications.

## 📘 ii. What I Learned from This Course
Throughout the course, I learned:

- The fundamentals of **AI search algorithms**, including:
  - **BFS (Breadth First Search)**
  - **DFS (Depth First Search)**
  - **DLS (Depth Limited Search)**
  - **IDS (Iterative Deepening Search)**
  - **Best First Search**
  - **Beam Search**
  - **A\* Algorithm**
- Implementation of **AI-based games** like:
  - **Tic Tac Toe (Minimax Algorithm)**
  - **Chess (Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning)**
  - **Nim Game (Minimax Algorithm)**
- Practical exploration of **AI tools** and applications.
- Developing problem-solving and logical thinking skills using Python.

This project strengthened my ability to design and implement **intelligent decision-making systems**.
